# WordPress Learning — rtCamp Course

This repo documents my learning journey through the [rtCamp WordPress Developer Course](https://learn.rtcamp.com/courses/wordpress-development/). I'm using it to practice building themes, plugins, and applying WordPress coding standards.

## 📁 Structure
- `/plugins` — custom plugins built during the course
- `/themes` — theme customization notes and experiments
- `/day-wise-notes` — markdown notes from each day of learning

## 🧠 Goals
- Understand WordPress core structure
- Build reusable plugins and custom themes
- Contribute to open-source WordPress projects
